LICENSE
=======
The use of TTUTIL is free under the following conditions: 
- The library or its documentation is not sold in any form.
- If you distribute in any way source code containing calls to 
  TTUTIL, you may include the TTUTIL library in its original form, 
  in a separate folder/subdirectory on your distribution media 
  containing all the material described in README.txt.
- If the library is part of a commercial product the TTUTIL
  library is mentioned in the product description as a free 
  utility library, packed with the product for convenience.
- A proper reference is made to TTUTIL and its authors in the 
  source code and documentation of a commercial or non-commercial
  product created with help of TTUTIL.
- If you distribute source code via internet, a link to TTUTIL is
  provided: http://www.alterra.nl/models/ttutil 
- If you have made changes in the library for your own purposes, 
  you do not replace the original TTUTIL routines on your
  distribution media.

if you have made changes in the library or even added new routines,
the best way to distribute them with the original TTUTIL sources is 
to put your new and amended utility routines in a separate folder. The
contents of this folder should then be copied onto a ready-to-compile 
TTUTIL folder in order to get the library you link with your program.
This extends the system we also use for machine dependent parts of 
the library (see README.txt).

These rules and guidelines are meant to simplify the updating of
TTUTIL for all users and to keep Fortran sources portable.
